## Consolidate PDFs and whatever extension you might need

### Explanation:

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
   - The script checks the `$OSTYPE` environment variable to determine the operating system and applies the relevant command.
   - For Windows, it works best in a Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment.

2. **Find and Copy**:
   - `find "$SOURCE_DIR" -type f -name "*.pdf" -exec cp {} "$TARGET_DIR" \;` searches for `.pdf` files and copies them to the target directory.

3. **Usage**:
   - Make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x consolidate_pdfs.sh
     ```
   - Run the script, specifying the source and target directories:
     ```bash
     ./consolidate_pdfs.sh /path/to/source /path/to/target
     ```

### GitHub Instructions

1. **Add the Script to GitHub**:
   - Add the `consolidate_pdfs.sh` file to your GitHub repository.
   - Commit and push your changes:
     ```bash
     git add consolidate_pdfs.sh
     git commit -m "Add script to consolidate PDF files"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Usage Example**:
   - Users can clone the repository and run the script on their system by specifying the source and target directories.

This script will be executable on both Mac/Linux and Windows environments using Git Bash or WSL, making it suitable for a cross-platform solution hosted on GitHub.
